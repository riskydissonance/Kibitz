"""Idle watchdog: self-terminate the server process after a stretch of inactivity.

The MCP server (and its in-process web board) is long-lived — Claude Code spawns it and it
otherwise runs until the machine reboots, so abandoned sessions can pile up as stray processes.
This module tracks a last-activity timestamp that the MCP tools and the web layer `touch()` on
every call, and a background thread that exits the process once it's been idle for
`config.SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`. Activity resets the timer, so an in-use session is never killed.

Exit is via `os._exit` after `engine.shutdown()`: the engine pool runs non-daemon threads, so a
plain return/`sys.exit` could hang — `os._exit` guarantees the process actually goes away.
