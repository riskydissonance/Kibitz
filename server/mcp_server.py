    Mistake sensitivity adapts to skill: stronger players get smaller win%-drop cutoffs (subtler
    errors flagged) and a slightly deeper sweep. If `elo`/`sensitivity` are omitted, the reviewed
    side's Elo is read from the PGN (normalized for Lichess vs Chess.com, whose scales differ).

    Args:
        pgn: The game in PGN format (Lichess/Chess.com exports work; comments and
            variations are ignored).

        elo: Override the player's strength (normalized scale) instead of reading the PGN.
        sensitivity: Or a named preset: "casual", "default", "strong", or "master".

    Returns a summary with per-side accuracy and an ordered list of the player's
    inaccuracies/mistakes/blunders. Each mistake has an `index` usable with `goto_mistake`,
    and a `fen_before` usable with `get_engine_line`. `review_elo`/`thresholds` show the
    sensitivity used. The full result is stored in the shared session the web board reads.
